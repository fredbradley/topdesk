# Changelog

All notable changes to `TOPDesk` will be documented in this file.

## Version 1.0.3

### Added
 - A whole bunch of methods which count various iterations of Incidents. I use these counts for a system status monitoring screen in our office.
 - Added [`fredbradley/cacher`](https://github.com/fredbradley/multiframework-cacher) which allows us to easily cache some relevant results (which won't change, like Person/Operator IDs, etc). The Cacher script is compatibile with both Laravel and WordPress.
